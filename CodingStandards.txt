Naming Conventions
    • Variables
        o Use only lower case
        o Use underscores to separate words in a name: first_name
        o Need to be descriptive: array_length
        o Commonly used variables like i, j, and k for loop control and array indexing are
        acceptable.
        o Arrays should indicate that it is multiple items: customers
    • Definitions
        o All #define statements must be in UPPER CASE: #define ARRAY_SIZE (10)
        o Except for using upper case follow variable naming conventions.
        o Always use parentheses around numeric values in #define statements.
        o Never use hard coded numbers except in #define statements.
    • Functions
        o Need to be descriptive: get_customer_account
        o Using a verb and an object often adds clarity: create_report
Comments
    • Need to describe purpose: // search array for a customer number
    • Do not just describe how the code works: a = b + c; // add b and c and put in a
    • Many programmers now prefer using // for single line comments.
    • /* */ syntax is still used but should be formatted to show clearly the range of comment text.
    • Inside functions describe the purpose of each significant section of code.
        o Loops should have a comment describing the loop’s purpose (unless obvious).
        o Complex expressions should be documented.
    • Functions must have a block of comments right above the function describing:
        o Purpose
        o Input parameter(s)
        o Output
